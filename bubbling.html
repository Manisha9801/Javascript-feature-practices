<!--Note
To the level from where we stop the propagation of event /bubbling, it won't trigger the same event of ancestors/parents.
When you will click on "p", click event of "p" will get executed along with that it will proceed further and trigger "click"
event of "div". But since on click handler of "div" we are using method "handleClick" where we are stopping the propgation 
of event. So the bubbling of event will stop and "click" event of "form" won't get trigger further.
